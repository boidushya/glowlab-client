## 👨‍💻 About Glowlab

Glowlab is an NFT marketplace running on the EVMOS that features per-item
customizable royalties.\
\
All Glowlab NFTs are ERC1155 compatible which means each one can have multiple
copies;\
\
They also implement the EIP-2981 Royalty Standard, which allows creators to set
a royalty percent that automatically gets transferred to their wallet whenever
future sales of the NFTs happen. No extra work needed.\
\
Glowlab supports image, video, and audio NFTs and all metadata is stored on
Filecoin and IPFS which means the content you're buying or selling will never be
taken down or tampered with.
